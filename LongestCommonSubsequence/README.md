LCS implementation from Cormen's book. I use a 2 dimensional vector of a pair<unsigned int, function> to represent the subsequence length and the 3 operators
for the left, up, and diagonal. The algorithm is very straighforward. The trick is coming up with the proof for optimal substructure. (Like every other dynamic programming optimization).
So my big problem, in the learning hierarcy, is the correlation portion. Rote. Done! Understanding, Si! Application, applied! Correlation, errr,
what other problems, besides the ones in the book, fits the framework for dynamic programming optimization?
