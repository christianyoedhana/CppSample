//Classic example: access to a person's bank account must be synchronized. Failure to do so results in robbery.
//Bank account represent a person's simple back account. Manages the debiting and crediting activity of a person's account
//Must write a custom copy constructor to copy just m_balance's shared value.
//Copy operator will be copying the content of m_balance to a new instance of BankAccount with an unlocked mutex
